                <h2>History Of Odisha</h2>
                <p>The history of Odisha begins in the Lower Paleolithic era, as Acheulian tools dating to the period have been discovered in various places in the region.[1] The early history of Odisha can be traced back to writings found in ancient texts like the Mahabharata, Maha Govinda Sutta and some Puranas. The region was also known to other kingdoms in region of East Indies due to maritime trade relations.</p>
                <p>
                    In 1568 CE, considered a pivotal point in the region's history, the region was conquered by the armies of the Sultanate of Bengal led by the iconoclast general Kalapahad. The region lost its political identity and the following rulers of the region were more often tributary lords than actual kings. By 1593, Odisha had passed completely to the Mughal Empire and became part of the Bengal Subah. After 1751, the Marathas gained control of the region.

                <p>
                    Odisha's remarkable architectural heritage shines through its ancient temples, left behind by the Aryans, with some ranking among the country's finest. Notably, the golden triangle of Odisha – comprising the Lingaraja Temple in Bhubaneswar (11th century), the Jagannath Temple in Puri (12th century), and the magnificent Sun Temple in Konark (13th century) – garners substantial tourism acclaim. These primary temples showcase the distinctive 'Kalinga' architectural style, with the Lingaraja Temple in Bhubaneswar, the largest among them, drawing over 6,000 visitors daily, where Lord Shiva is venerated as Harihara, a fusion of Vishnu and Shiva.
